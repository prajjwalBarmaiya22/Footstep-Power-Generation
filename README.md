## Introduction
Piezoelectric materials generate electrical energy when subjected to mechanical stress. This project aims to use piezoelectric sensors installed under a floor surface to harness the energy produced when people walk over it. The system can store this energy in batteries for later use or power low-energy devices such as LED lights or sensors.

## Features
- Real-time energy harvesting from footsteps.
- Energy storage using a battery system.
- Power output suitable for small devices (LEDs, sensors, etc.).
- Cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for renewable energy generation.
- Potential applications in public walkways, transportation hubs, and parks.

## System Architecture
The system is built around piezoelectric sensors, which convert the mechanical energy from footsteps into electrical energy. This energy is rectified and stored in a battery. The stored power can then be used to power small devices or provide energy feedback to a display showing the total power generated.

## Hardware Components
- **Piezoelectric Sensors**: Converts mechanical stress from footsteps into electricity.
- **Rectifier Circuit**: Converts the AC voltage generated by the piezoelectric sensors into DC.
- **Rechargeable Battery**: Stores the generated energy for later use.
- **Power Output**: Powers small devices such as LEDs, displays, or sensors.
  
### Additional Components:
- Voltage Regulator
- Microcontroller (optional, for monitoring and controlling power output)
- Display unit (optional, to show energy harvested)

## Installation
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect piezoelectric sensors beneath the floor surface.
   - Route the output to a rectifier circuit.
   - Connect the rectified output to a battery storage system.
   - Optionally, connect a display unit or small device to demonstrate power output.

## Usage
- Walk on the surface embedded with piezoelectric sensors.
- The system will automatically convert footsteps into electrical energy.
- View the power output on the display (if connected) or measure the output directly from the battery.

## Future Enhancements
- Increase the efficiency of power generation by optimizing sensor placement and piezoelectric materials.
- Develop an energy management system for larger-scale applications.
- Integrate IoT features for remote monitoring and control.
- Expand the system to generate higher power outputs for larger devices.
